          <p class="author-info">Posted by <span>@drew</span> on June 1, 2017</p>
          <div>
            <p>As we finish the closed beta and begin Season 6, I just want to say a big thanks to everyone involved, from the staff to the players. I'd say the beta was a success as we had over 100 different players play in over 100 games. Our winners for
              Season 5 are: Kel in 1st place, Mango in 2nd, major in 3rd, aspii in 4th, JKronic in 5th and KingSynq in 6th.<br>
              <br> The stats have been completely reset for season 6, which will last 2 weeks. The prize pool is currently at $100, which may change depending on any new donations that come in as well as how many new players sign up and pay for the current
              season. The prizes are anyones to take, so good luck and see you on the ladder!</p>

            <p>Version 0.0.4 was just deployed which includes the initial player profile views. More work to come on this but wanted to get the first draft out. Other changes included in this release: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Team Captains are now shown on the recent games list and cleaned up the view a bit</li>
              <li>More improvements to the leaderboard: season duration, prizes, and win percentage are now shown</li>
              <li>Implemented a cache for the leaderboard so you should notice it loading faster</li>
